introduction: |-
  This is GitHub Action that can be used as a workflow for automatic updates via Pull Requests in your infrastructure repository according to versions in components sources.

  ### Key Features:

  - **Selective Component Processing:** Configure the action to `exclude` or `include` specific components using wildcards, ensuring that only relevant updates are processed.
  - **PR Management:** Limit the number of PRs opened at a time, making it easier to manage large-scale updates without overwhelming the system. Automatically close old component-update PRs, so they don't pile up.
  - **Material Changes Focus:** Automatically open pull requests only for components with significant changes, skipping minor updates to `component.yaml` files to reduce unnecessary PRs and maintain a streamlined system.
  - **Informative PRs:** Link PRs to release notes for new components, providing easy access to relevant information, and use consistent naming for easy tracking.
  - **Scheduled Updates:** Run the action on a cron schedule tailored to your organization's needs, ensuring regular and efficient updates.

usage: |-
  ### Prerequisites

  This GitHub Action once used in workflow needs permissions to create/update branches and open/close pull requests so the access token needs to be passed.

  It can be done in two ways:
  - create a dedicated Personal Access Token (PAT)
  - use [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#about-the-github_token-secret)

  If you would like to use `GITHUB_TOKEN` make sure to set permissions in the workflow as follow:
  
  ```yaml
  permissions:
  - contents: write
  - pull-requests: write
  ```

  Also, make sure that you set to `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests` on both organization and repository levels:
  - `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR-ORG/settings/actions`
  - `https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO/settings/actions`

  ### Workflow example

  ```yaml
    name: "atmos-components"

    on:
      workflow_dispatch: {}

      schedule:
        - cron:  '0 8 * * 1'         # Execute every week on Monday at 08:00

    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write

    jobs:
