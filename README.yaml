usage: |-
  ### Prerequisites

  This GitHub Action once used in workflow needs permissions to create/update branches and open/close pull requests so the access token needs to be passed.

  It can be done in two ways:
  - create a dedicated Personal Access Token (PAT)
  - use [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#about-the-github_token-secret)

  If you would like to use `GITHUB_TOKEN` make sure to set permissions in the workflow as follow:
  
  ```yaml
  permissions:
  - contents: write
  - pull-requests: write
  ```

  Also, make sure that you set to `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests` on both organization and repository levels:
  - `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR-ORG/settings/actions`
  - `https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO/settings/actions`

  ### Workflow example

  ```yaml
    name: "atmos-components"

    on:
      workflow_dispatch: {}

      schedule:
        - cron:  '0 8 * * 1'         # Execute every week on Monday at 08:00

    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write

    jobs:
      update:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
